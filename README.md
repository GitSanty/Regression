# The Mission

My time machine is set to the year 2100! I want to arrive in the country with the longest expected life expectancy!
Choose 5 countries and regress their life expectancy data. Extrapolate and predict the life expectancy for the future.

 
## What
Life expectancy is the key metric for assessing population health


## Process and analysis
* data collection, data cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis
* feature selection, feature engineering
* model selection 
* model optimization based on selected performance metric    


## Polynomial linear regression
Polynomial regression model use to powers of a single predictor by the method of linear least squares. Interpolation and calculation of areas under the curve are also given.

The formula for a Polynomial linear regression is:
